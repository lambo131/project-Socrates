While the recycling work of A4 paper has been impressive, wouldn't the impact be\\nmore significant if we start developing innovative recycled paper products? Moreover, there is low\\ntransparency in how recycled paper is processed and utilized in HKUST as students are rarely involved\\nin the paper recycling manufacturing process. These problems would in turn restrict students'\\nimagination and interest in paper recycling and sustainability in general, which eventually lead to\\ndifficulty in reducing paper and other waste in HKUST in the long run.\\nOur Sustainable Solution\\nWe wish to provide students opportunities to experience the comprehensive cycle of recycling paper\\nwaste into products and impact the lifestyles of students and even the global community.\\n1. Paper product innovation and manufacturing workshop (team workshop)\\nIn the team workshops, we will focus on developing innovative pulp products. Our goal is to work with\\ndifferent organizations of HKUST and provide practical HKUST-made paper products. We believe, by\\napplying innovative paper products to different campus settings, our project could influence students to\\nlive more sustainably, and promote a more innovation-friendly environment on campus.\\n2. Paper recycling and product development experience workshop (experience workshop)\\nOur experience workshops will provide opportunities for students to recycle paper into pulp,\\ndesign, and create paper products to take home. We aim to educate students about how paper\\nwaste is recycled and applied in daily life so that they can be more familiar with sustainable\\nproducts and make smarter decisions as citizens, consumers, and entrepreneurs in the future.\\nProcess of Creating Pulp Products\\nThis is the general process of how our paper products will be developed:\\n1.\\nPaper waste collection\\nType of material and collection method:\\nPulp is made\\nof cellulose fiber, which can be obtained from\\na wide variety of paper waste. This includes writing paper, newspapers, egg cartons, and cardboard\\nboxes. However, only paper without coating will be used. All paper waste will be collected from the\\nrecycling bins on campus.\\nMaterial pre-treatment:\\nAny nonpaper material on the\\npaper like labels or tapes should be removed in\\nadvance.\\n2.\\nShred paper\\n:\\nUse a shredding machine to shred paper\\ninto pieces\\n.\\nDifferent types of paper material\\ncan be mixed together, and it doesn‚Äôt affect the quality.\\n1\", metadata={'source': '../rsc/Proposal 2nd draft.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='3.\\nMaking paper pulp\\n:\\n(1)\\nPut the shredded paper into a blender.\\n(2)\\nAdd hot water to half the amount of\\npaper.\\n(3)\\nAdd fiber binder (glue). We can use PVA glue and also organic rice paste, which is an\\neco-friendly choice.\\n(4)\\nBlend it until it is a uniform\\npaste.\\n(5)\\nAdd dye to give pulp color (if needed)\\n4.\\nMold pressing pulp\\n:\\nThe fundamental principle of\\nmold pressing paper pulp into shaped products is\\nshown on the right. We will design the mold based on\\nthe shape, size, and characteristics of the product. To\\nbe systematic, we will use this basic principle for all of\\nour manufacturing methods. Our molds can be either\\n3D printed or CNC machined. More of our technical\\nconsiderations are in the ‚ÄúExtra‚Äù section. Below are the\\nprocedures:\\n1.\\nRemove excess water from the pulp with a\\nsqueezing machine\\n2.\\nInsert pulp into pressing mold. The input volume should be around 150%\\nof the final size of the product.\\n3.\\nPress the mold with a pressing machine. It would be better to use a\\nhydraulic machine, but it is not required. Other cheap or free methods can\\nbe used compromising quality.\\n5.\\nDrying\\n:\\nFor highly compressed pulp, remove the compressed\\npulp from the\\nmold. Leave it to dry for a few days or put it in an oven to dry faster. For Less\\ncompressed pulp, If we would like a less dense product or if the product is\\npressed with insufficient force, then the pressed product will be wetter. It is\\nbetter to leave it in the mold for one day, and then take it out to dry.\\nImplementation\\nWorkshop and Schedule\\nTeam workshops\\nStudent Experiencing workshops\\nParticipants\\nTeam members only . We need around 10 team \\nmembers\\n20-25 participants per session, and all students are\\nwelcome\\nContent\\nStep 1:\\nGet product orders from HKUST \\norganizations.\\nStep 2:\\nR&D: (1) Experiment with the paper \\nmolding process, document problems, and\\nsuccesses, and refine the production method for\\nspecific products\\nStep 3:\\nManufacture products\\nSession 1(online):\\nOnline classes teaching students \\nto design their custom mold press + 3D print mold\\npress on Campus\\nSession 2(f2f):\\nMaking paper pulp and shaping the \\npulp with their own molds or our prepared molds\\nSession 3(f2f):\\nEmbellish and color their own dried \\npulp product + Summary\\nSchedule\\nand Length\\nLong-term team:\\nThe schedule will be adjusted according to product\\nsupply needs\\n2-3 workshops/semester , 3 dif ferent sessions within 2 \\nweeks. Flexibility for participants to join any 1 to 3\\nsessions. 2-3 hours per session.\\nExperience W orkshop\\nStudents will use Fusion 360 to CAD model their own designs. The structure of the mold press\\nmechanism will be provided, so they only need to transfer the shape of their product onto the mold\\npress mechanism. This will be a relatively simple task that students with no experience can\\nachieve. For teaching, we will lead the workshops with professors. In the future, we can even\\ncollaborate with local external partners, such as Mill Mill, in organizing more diverse paper\\n2', metadata={'source': '../rsc/Proposal 2nd draft.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='recycling workshops to further raise students‚Äô and public awareness of paper recycling and its\\napplication.\\nRequirements and cost\\nWe need\\n(1)\\na room to execute workshops,\\n(2)\\nA hydraulic\\npressing machine/substitute:\\n10000HKD/free,\\n(3)\\nA paper shredding machine,\\n(4)\\nBlender,\\n(5)\\n3D printers,\\n(6)\\ncheap miscellaneous\\nmaterials. The school already has some of our required facilities or equipment, which can further bring\\ndown our costs.\\nOur Team Workshop Products\\nPaper Trophy\\nCurrently, there are very few awards in HKUST that consist of recycled materials.\\nHence, we propose a paper trophy made of paper waste on campus for the HKUST\\nsustainability departments, which can be used as a prize for students with\\nsustainability achievements in the future. The recycled paper materials can also be\\ncombined into any other prizes in the long run for promoting sustainability.\\nThe trophies can be made by assembling their recycled paper components together,\\nwhile the text on the trophy can be spray painted, laser engraved, or sticker foil\\napplied. For humidity concerns, we can apply eco-friendly epoxy resin to make it\\nwater-resistant.\\nOther product ideas\\nWe wish to design a wide variety of products that bring convenience and sustainability to students and\\nthe campus. Our products range from different types of containers and decorations to others like\\nsouvenirs. We will come up with more creative ideas and discover more possibilities for paper-made\\nproducts with other HKUST students in the future.\\nThe picture shows some of our product ideas\\n(More product ideas and photos can be found in\\nour extra session!)\\nOther applications of our products:\\n-\\nCollaboration with Sustainability\\nDepartments\\n: They can also be served as\\ngifts for students when they achieve certain\\ntargets in sustainability campaigns to\\nencourage the use of sustainable products.\\n-\\nCollaboration with other departments and\\nsocieties:\\nWe can provide products such as\\npaper-pencil boxes for departments or\\nsocieties as their event giveaways (e.g. on\\norientation days). Content such as the logo\\nand the name of the organization can also be\\ncustomized and printed on our products.
