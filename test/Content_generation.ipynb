      "summary: \"The Ocean Cleanup has signed an agreement to deploy an Interceptor™ Original in the Cisadane River in Indonesia. This will be the second Interceptor deployed in Indonesia and is part of The Ocean Cleanup's commitment to addressing plastic pollution in the country and Southeast Asia. The deployment of Interceptor 020 is scheduled before the end of 2023 and will help tackle the estimated 1000 tons of plastic that enter the Java Sea each year. The Cisadane River is a priority for Indonesian authorities and for The Ocean Cleanup, especially in light of the Joint Declaration agreed as part of Indonesia's hosting of the G20 Summit in 2022. The Interceptor 020 is another step towards intercepting 80% of plastic leakage into the oceans and helping Indonesia reduce marine plastic debris by 70% in 2025. The Interceptor Original is a sustainable solution powered by solar energy that autonomously extracts plastic from rivers and deposits it into dumpsters on a floating barge. The Interceptor portfolio includes other designs such as the Interceptor Trashfence, Interceptor Barrier, and Interceptor Tender. The deployment of Interceptor 020 involves collaboration with partners BBWS Cilliwung-Cisadane, Tangerang Regency - DLHK, and Tanjung Burung Waste Bank. It is part of the Global Implementation Partnership with The Coca-Cola Company and has received financial support from True Ventures and ThatGameCompany.\"\n",
